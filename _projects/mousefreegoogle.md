excerpt: "Using google with the keyboard"

I use Vim a lot when I code so I created a tool which I can search google with only keyboard motions to 'stay in the flow state'. The links in the screenshot below have a number next to them so I can click '1' and it will bring me to CNN's page.

It works okay. The biggest issue is with links inside of dropdowns because the number gets to like 150 on the front page.

ChatGPT was a decent help for this one to quickly get up to speed on how to work with chrome extensions. 

It is a bit of productivity overkill I would say.
