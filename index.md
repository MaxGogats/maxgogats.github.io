# Hello!

Welcome to my technical focused blog where I build in public and share ideas.

Blogs have been a source of enjoyment for me I hope to write or share content which can inspire people 1% of how much it has for me. 

## About me 

I first really got into computers as a junior in high school when I played Need For Speed on my brothers newly built NVIDIA powered gaming computer. 

It took me some time but I did the research, saved up the money, and put together a gaming PC. It mostly worked on the first try, I think it failed to post to the BIOS because the RAM sticks were in the wrong slot.

From there it was python codecademy, to an intro high school computer science, to computer science degree, to working professional. 

My current title is 'Onboarding Engineer' where I design and implement solutions to integrate new clients onto our companies platform. 

## Posts 

*Currently* I am working through the Fast.ai machine learning textbook to learn how machine learning really works. I wrote a paper in college about supervised and unsupervised machine learning which was fun to do and sounds really smart and interesting when talked about. In reality, it is way simpler than it sounds, mostly about training data and reinforcement learning. 

I do intend to use this website as a place to review my current learnings and hopefully develop some projects to turn me into an employable data professional.

## Failed Project Ideas 

**Mousefree Google** -- This project is a chrome extension which uses the number keys rather than the mouse to click on links. I like using vim and keyboard shortcuts so I created something to navigate google with instead of using the mouse

**Dartmaster recreation** -- I wanted to create a dartmaster board learning electronic circuits and hardware. It is too time consuming to learn how to do that entire project although it did expose me to an interesting sites like this one *https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/** 

**Discord music bot** -- I actually had this one working for a week or two and my friends were using it. It relied upon a third party github library that needed to be npm updated daily for it to work. Looking back I could've automated that task but there are plenty of existing discord bots with better maintainers.
