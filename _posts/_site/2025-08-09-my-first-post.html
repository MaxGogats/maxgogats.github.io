<p>I came across this course/book https://course.fast.ai/ from a hackernews/lobst.ers link about Fast.ai, an educational machine learning platform.</p>

<p>Chapter 1 suggested to create a blog to follow along and reinforce the learning. It goes hand in hand with advice Iâ€™ve heard from students about the importance of building projects alongside a book/course.</p>

<p>The preface speaks on how accessible deep learning is to everyone and how Fast.ai approaches teaching. They ask for the reader to set goals for things deep learning can help with such as identifying poisonous plants or if an email is spam.</p>

<p>The first chapter is focused on setting on the development environment using Jupyter notebooks with an NVIDIA GPU which is straightforward. Additionally it covers deep learning jargon like neural networks and reinforcement learning.</p>
