I came across this course/book [Fast AI](https://course.fast.ai/) from [Hackernews](news.ycombinator.com) link about Fast.ai, an educational machine learning platform. 

Chapter 1 suggested to create a blog to follow along and reinforce the learning. It goes hand in hand with advice I've heard from students about the importance of building projects alongside a book/course.

The preface speaks on how accessible deep learning is to everyone and how Fast.ai approaches teaching. They ask for the reader to set goals for things deep learning can help with such as identifying poisonous plants or if an email is spam. My tangible goals from this course is to gain familiarity with both a deep learning and big data Python library.

The first chapter is focused on setting on the development environment using Jupyter notebooks with an NVIDIA GPU and getting the reader up to date on some common deep learning terms like neural networks and reinforcement learning. Video to follow setting up the development environment.
